Builder Pattern builds a complex object using simple objects using a step-by-step approach.
This is a creational pattern. 

A dedicated builder class builds the final object step-by-step. This is independent of other classes. 

This example is from https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/builder_pattern.htm

Use Builder pattern when :
- The algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object, and how they are assembled.
- The construction process must allow different representations for the object that is constructed.
